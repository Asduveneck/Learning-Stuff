### Summaries
When to use log instead of lin scales
syntax for log scales


### Why do we need log scales?
1. Variables increase exponentially (ex: bacteria growth)
2. Domain is so large that there's a lot of wasted space (ex: GDP per capita over time.)

### Syntax:
We can specify the base
Domain for log scale needs to be strictly >0

Syntax
```js
d3.scaleLog()
```

The base is an optional argument.
