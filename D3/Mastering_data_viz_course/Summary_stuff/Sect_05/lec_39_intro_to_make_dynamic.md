D3 can add beautiful transitions to let us switch up data.

We'll learn how to use the D3 update pattern adn see what d3 does behind the scenes.

we'll add an update function that lets us switch between data, then update it to a scatterplot.

We should be comfortable with the d3 pattern by the time we're done.

We'll recreate a famous viz, the gapminder project, to showcase our knowledge of d3.
