I've already read books on design, so I'll be blasting through this section

### 30: Intro

  There are best practices to be aware of, different types of graphs, data, good clarity, and we'll be introduced to the boot strap CSS grid system.

### 31: Design for clarity

  * Best practices for visual design
  * Intro to Tufte's design principles (clear, easy to read data visualizations)
  * Ex of good and bad uses of visualizations

What are key design factors?
  * Make the dat easy to interpret
  * Be truthful/credible: don't mislead
  * Focus on important stuff

Tufte's principles focus on staying honest to the data and eliminating distracting elements:

Summary of visualizations with Tufte's principles
  * Be truthful and don't distort meaning. Ex: y axis should start w/ 0 to avoid over exageration
  * Lie factor: Size of effect in data vs size of graphic. Should be as close to 1 as possible.
  * Chart Junk: Elements that don't add extra info. In general, unnecessary elements, framing elements, background elements, 3d things, are typically bad.
  * Data to Ink ratio can measure chart junk. Focus on high data to ink.
