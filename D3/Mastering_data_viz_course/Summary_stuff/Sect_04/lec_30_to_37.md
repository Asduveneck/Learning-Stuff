I've already read books on design, so I'll be blasting through this section

### 30: Intro

  There are best practices to be aware of, different types of graphs, data, good clarity, and we'll be introduced to the boot strap CSS grid system.

### 31: Design for clarity

  * Best practices for visual design
  * Intro to Tufte's design principles (clear, easy to read data visualizations)
  * Ex of good and bad uses of visualizations

What are key design factors?
  * Make the dat easy to interpret
  * Be truthful/credible: don't mislead
  * Focus on important stuff

Tufte's principles focus on staying honest to the data and eliminating distracting elements:

Summary of visualizations with Tufte's principles
  * Be truthful and don't distort meaning. Ex: y axis should start w/ 0 to avoid over exageration
  * Lie factor: Size of effect in data vs size of graphic. Should be as close to 1 as possible.
  * Chart Junk: Elements that don't add extra info. In general, unnecessary elements, framing elements, background elements, 3d things, are typically bad.
  * Data to Ink ratio can measure chart junk. Focus on high data to ink.

### 32: Subjectivity in Design

  * What makes a great visualization?
  * Is chart junk a bad thing? Some chart junk others argue are necessary
  * Examples of good visualizations that don't follow Tufte's principles

What are goals for viz?
  * Grab users attention
  * Encourage further exploration
  * Build new and interesting types of visualizations

Ex: histogram of military spending. Histograms are harder to understand than a barchart. And each histogram is a bullet... lots of chart junk

Ex: Node link: interactive.

Design is still subjective. 

### 33: Activity: critiquing visualizations

1. Visualization of coffee: Eye catching, but I don't know what hte bars or colors even mean.
2. Lancaster Bingo. A lot of negative space. I love dashboards and they're clear and have a good amount of data to ink. I like the color scheme too. Issue is the pie chart in the middle
3. Rap vocab, indifferent towards. I get that it's a scatter plot at first, which is interesting because each point is represented by a face. I guess that is somewhat clarifying, but also adds a lot of distraction (to me)

As an aside, I just learned about https://pudding.cool/2018/12/3d-cities-story/ and https://pudding.cool/ which is a pretty cool site.
