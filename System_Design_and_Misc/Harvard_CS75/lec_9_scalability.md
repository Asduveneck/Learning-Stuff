# Scalability

source

## Web hosts and VPses: Where do you put your site online?

### What features do you want to look for in a web host?

  Doing due diligence to check for IP address ranges
  SFTP instead of FTP (S for Secure).
  Have username and password encrypted (hence, SFTP over FTP)

  Shared Host: host a website.

### What differences between VPSes or shared host?

  VPSes: Rent a virtual server. So you get your own copy of Ubuntu / Linux. Probably a powerful server fragmented.
  You get some slice of hardware, and no one else has the same account for those accounts.
  Webhostsyou share all.
  AWS Elastic Cloud: Lets you power up more servers and shut them down automatically.

## Scaling

### Vertical Scaling (7:45)

  Throw more disk spaces and money.
  You hit a ceiling. Why isn't this a full solution?
  You can only buy a machine up to the state of the art tech (or budget).
  You can sometimes throw multi cpu multi core.
  Current laptops can only do 2-4 things at once (based upon threading). Why do they seem to multi task though?
    they just switch between tasks so quickly; kinda like JS event loop XD
