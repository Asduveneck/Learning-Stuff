## What happens when you go to google.com?

Go to a website.

To find the random IP address, we have root servers. Root servers take you to
A packet, virtual envelope, message, goes to router to router until it gets to the actual server, matches the IP address, and sends it back.

Grabs the file, flips the server and sender, and sends a packet back. 

## What if we want to build a website?

The routers have their own IP address
And routers with 192.168 , 172.16, 10. , are private address on your own network. Your personal devices are on these networks.

When you use a protocol like HTTP, you'll be using other protocols behind the scenes (TCP/ICP with HTTP).

We have Port Numbers. IF a website is running, we are using port 80. Email will send data to port 25.
Emails can contain html now, so we need to distinguish between the two. 

Take your home router, your modem, configure it to say that any internet that comes in destined for port 80, should take incoming data, and route it to the computer for your website.

What if you're doing port forwarding this way? Only one website can have it default to :80 . Most browsers have `:80` typed in automatically.

Portss like 80 or 443.

### How do we outsource this instead of running on personal computer at home?

  Go to a data center. Buy a domain. (ex: www. asd . com)
  Now that we have a domain, we need a server. A web hosting company. They have ram, staff, server, and hopefully at least 2... DNS servers
  Their server has 2 DNS. Those servers will tell every other computer that when they go to your domain you paid for, they navigate to the hosts ip address.
